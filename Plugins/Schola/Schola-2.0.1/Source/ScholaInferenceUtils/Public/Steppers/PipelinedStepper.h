/**
 * @brief Pipelined stepper implementation for asynchronous inference.
 * 
 * A sophisticated stepper that pipelines agent observations and policy inference
 * across multiple frames to hide inference latency. Uses a two-stage pipeline:
 * 
 * Frame N:   Collect observations -> Dispatch async inference
 * Frame N+1: Apply actions from N   -> Collect observations -> Dispatch async inference
 * 
 * This allows the policy to perform inference on a background thread while the
 * game continues running, significantly reducing effective latency for expensive
 * inference operations. The stepper manages synchronization between the game
 * thread and inference threads.
