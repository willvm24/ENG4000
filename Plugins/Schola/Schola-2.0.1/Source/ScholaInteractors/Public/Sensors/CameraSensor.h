/**
 * @brief Camera sensor that collects 2D image observations from the environment.
 * 
 * This sensor uses a SceneCaptureComponent2D and a RenderTarget to capture images from the environment.
 * The captured images are converted to normalized floating-point arrays suitable for neural network input.
 * 
 * @details 
 * To use this sensor:
 * 1. Create a UTextureRenderTarget2D asset in the Unreal Editor
 * 2. Assign it to the TextureTarget property (inherited from USceneCaptureComponent2D)
 * 3. Configure which color channels to include via EnabledChannels
 * 
 * Change the CaptureSource setting to choose the mode of operation:
 * - SCS_FinalColorLDR: Standard RGB rendering
 * - SCS_SceneDepth: Depth-only rendering
 * - SCS_SceneColorSceneDepth: Combined RGB and depth
 * 
 * RenderTarget setting recommendations:
 *   Advanced --> Shared = true
 * 
 * SceneCaptureComponent2D setting recommendations:
 *   bCaptureEveryFrame = true
 *   bRenderInMainRenderer = true
 *   CompositeMode = overwrite
 * 
 * @see https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/1.7---scene-capture-2d
